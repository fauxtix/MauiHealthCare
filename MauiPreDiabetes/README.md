## Model used:

1. Group of ages (in years) (less than 35, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65 or more); 
2. Smoking habit;
3. Medicated for blood pressure;
4. Parents with type 2 diabetes; 
5. Physical activity;
6. Vegetables and fruits consumption;
7. Waist circunference for woman and men.

__Breaking down each factor__:

- **Group of Ages**: Age is a significant factor, and categorizing it into groups allows for a more nuanced assessment.

- **Smoking Habit**: Smoking has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, so including this as a risk factor is appropriate.

- **Medicated for Blood Pressure**: Hypertension is a known risk factor for diabetes, and including whether someone is on medication for blood pressure is relevant.

- **Parents with Diabetes**: Family history is a crucial factor in assessing genetic predisposition to diabetes.

- **Physical Activity**: Regular physical activity is associated with a lower risk of diabetes, so including this is important.

- **Vegetables and Fruits Consumption**: Dietary habits, including vegetable consumption, play a role in diabetes risk.

- **Waist Circumference for Men and Women**: Abdominal obesity, as measured by waist circumference, is a well-established risk factor.

Considering these factors provides a holistic view of an individual's risk for developing diabetes. However, the accuracy of the risk assessment will also depend on the weights assigned to each factor and the specific algorithm used to calculate the overall risk score.

The calculation of risk scores for pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes can vary based on the specific research study or clinical tool being used. Different scoring systems incorporate a combination of risk factors and assign weights to each factor based on its relative importance in predicting the likelihood of developing diabetes. These scores are often derived from large-scale epidemiological studies and clinical trials.

Here are a couple of well-known risk scores used in research and clinical practice:

**FINDRISC** (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score):

>The FINDRISC is a widely used tool that originated in Finland. It includes questions about age, BMI, waist circumference, physical activity, dietary habits, history of elevated blood glucose, and family history of diabetes. Points are assigned to each answer, and the total score is used to categorize individuals into different risk groups.
AUSDRISK (Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool):

>**AUSDRISK** is a tool developed in Australia to identify individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It considers age, gender, family history, nationality, physical activity, dietary habits, and waist circumference. Similar to FINDRISC, it assigns points to each risk factor, and the total score helps determine the risk level.

**IDRS** (Indian Diabetes Risk Score):

>The IDRS is specifically designed for the Indian population. It includes age, waist circumference, physical activity, and family history. Points are assigned, and the total score is used to categorize individuals into different risk categories.
QDiabetes Score:

>**QDiabetes** is a risk assessment tool used in the United Kingdom. It considers age, sex, BMI, smoking status, family history of diabetes, and socioeconomic status. Points are assigned to each factor, and the total score is used to estimate the 10-year risk of developing diabetes.
American Diabetes Association (ADA) Risk Test:

>**ADA** provides a simple online risk test that considers age, gender, family history, physical activity, and BMI to estimate the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
These scores are not universally applicable, and their accuracy may vary in different populations. It's crucial to note that the interpretation of risk scores should be done in consultation with healthcare professionals, and individuals identified as high risk may be recommended for further diagnostic tests or preventive interventions.

For the most up-to-date and context-specific risk assessment, it's advisable to refer to the guidelines and tools recommended by relevant health organizations in your region.
